-There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general (3 pt).
1. Yes, the advantage on the refactoring one is that you are using a related variable which help us to run the macro no matter how many Indexes are, even it can be done with additional programation so If an additional Index is added or deleted it can be updated automatically, instead of assign a direct value to each "Tickers" array.

There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
1. Yes, the original script can be use only if all the indexes are maintained during the two years, if any is added or deteled, the script wont work.
